        <h3 class="heading-style">What If Someone Doesn’t Pay?</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, there is one person in the group who says that they just do not have the money to pay for
            their portion of the bill.
            Unfortunately, the burden of that person’s meal is now on his or her friends,and it is never a good
            situation when a friend won’t pay you back.
            However, there are a few ways to deal with this situation:</p>

                <h3 class="heading-style">1. Let it Slide </h3>
                <p> If someone doesn’t pay his or her portion of the bill once, just let it slide. Consider it a gift,
                    with
                    the expectation that it will not become an ongoing occurrence. But in the future, discuss splitting
                    the
                    bill with this friend before you leave for the restaurant. </p>

                <h3 class="heading-style"> 2. Don’t Go Out with That Person </h3>
                <p> If someone gets into the habit of talking their way out of paying for their food, stop going out
                    with
                    that friend. Eventually, he or she will get the message.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-style"> 3. Loan the Money </h3>
                <p> Offer to pay for the person, but make it clear that you expect to be paid back the next time you see
                    them. A straightforward statement like, “Sure, no problem. I can lend you the money. Just pay me
                    back as
                    soon as you get a chance,” works well. This way, the person knows that he or she is expected to
                    repay
                    the loan.</p>
