    <h1>SHARING</h1>
    <p>When you dine out with other people, do you pay for your own food and drink, or divide the bill so that everyone makes an
     equal contribution? Splitting a bill can be a source of conflict among friends, especially if one person is trying to avoid 
     contributing at all. It can be difficult to split bills fairly, without antagonizing anyone in the process.</p>
     
     <p>Money can be a touchy subject, and people donâ€™t always react well when prompted for their contribution towards a bill.
        Now, more than ever, paying too much when dining out can be a financial burden. Although the amounts spent at restaurants 
        may not seem like much, the meals can quickly add up to a significant amount of money. </p>
